Sales Prediction of a Sandwich Store Chain

Welcome to my project from a real-life Sandwich stores dataset from a POS(point-of-sale) system of 10 stores across a state in the United States of America.
One of the main reasons why I chose this dataset is the fact that the data is limited and so is most of the data from small to medium size businesses in most rural counties anywhere in the world. The data available is the weekly sales of their menu items for a period of a year from 2012 - 2013.

The sales data were anonymized by renaming menu items and renumbering the stores. Locations were anonymized by changing the names of cities, counties, and states. None of the other data was changed so that any conclusions drawn from the data can still be valid. Keys to de-anonymize the data are held by the authors.

The data may be correlated to demographics, crime and weather, but have chosen to focus on sales of the menu items to predict and leave the correlations to other factors for another day.
